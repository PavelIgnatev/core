I believe the restriction on my ability to send messages was imposed in error and insist that I have not engaged in any negative or suspicious activities; this should be considered when drafting the appeal. Account suspension â‰  restriction on the ability to send messages, keep this in mind. My account is restricted from sending messages, not suspended! Do not use the phrase that I was restricted from sending messages, as it is implied when writing the appeal. Character limit: no more than 300. Sentence limit: no more than 3.
